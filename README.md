# Analysis_of_Netfix_Dataset:

**Netflix Dataset Analysis**

**Overview**:

This project explores a large dataset of Netflix titles and performs data analysis and visualization using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It helps answer questions like:

What types of content are on Netflix?

How are they distributed by genre, country, release year, and rating?

What trends and patterns exist in the content library?

**Dataset**:

Source: netflixtitles.csv (Not included in repo—please download separately)

Rows: ~8,800 titles

Columns: show_id, type, title, director, cast, country, date_added, release_year, rating, duration, listed_in, description

**Key Steps**:

Reading and loading the data

Exploring missing values and unique entries

Cleaning and transforming columns (e.g. extracting duration as a numeric value)

Basic statistics (mean, min, max, counts, etc.)

Visualizing categorical and numerical data

Gaining insights through boxplots, histograms, scatterplots, counts and trends

**How to run**:

Open the notebook (Netflix.ipynb) in Google Colab or Jupyter.

Make sure netflixtitles.csv is in the same folder.

Run all cells to see analysis and outputs.

**Main Libraries Used:**

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

**Example Insights**:

Distribution of content by type (Movie vs TV Show)

Genres with the most entries

Year-wise trends in releases

Rating breakdowns

Outliers and extremes in duration

Missing value handling and data cleaning steps

**Instructions**:

Load the dataset.

Follow the step-by-step cells for cleaning, exploring, and visualizing.

Customize charts to explore more specific relationships.
